				<h2>Types of Storefronts</h2>
			</div>
			<p>After the breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic, the NYC Department of Finance began collecting datapoints on the 75,000 storefronts found across the city. The dataset, which covers just the following two years of the pandemic, captures the types of occupied storefronts, as well as the number of vacant storefronts, labeled as "No business activity identified."</p>

				<h2>Vacancy Rate vs. Land Price</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The scatterplot aims to explore the correlation between the storefront vacancy rate and the unit land
				price of the buildings in each NTA region. Since the price of land can be a good indicator of the
				wealth/poverty level of the neighborhoods, comparing the vacancy rate with the median land price might
				tell us whether the storefronts in less wealthy neighborhoods suffer more from pandemics than the
				wealthy neighborhoods.<br><br>

				<i>The size of the circle means the counts of the storefront in the NTA. By clicking the button below,
				the scatterplot of different boroughs will be shown in the chart. Moreover, when your mouse hovers over
				the circle, more information about the NTA will be revealed. </i>

				<h2>Vacancies Across New York City Neighborhoods</h2>
			</div>
			<p>As COVID-19 battered New York City in 2019, neighborhoods experienced changes in storefront vacancies that varied greatly by geographic location. 
				Once popular tourist destinations, neighborhoods like Hudson Yards and Midtown experienced a sharp decline in business activity that was well documented. 
				Other neighborhoods, like Flushing and Astoria in Queens, experienced severe increases in vacancies while receiving less attention. <br><br>

				<i>Feel free to explore the distribution of vacancies in 2020, 2021, and the change from one versus the other. Zoom into the neighborhoods to 
					identify vacant storefronts, and click to obtain additional information.</i></p>

				<h2>Reported vacancies vs. Lived Experiences</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Open data from the City confirms that neighborhoods such as Astoria were hit particularly hard. However, because only what is reported is displayed, 
				itâ€™s important to understand how reported data matches lived experiences on the ground. The next step in our investigation will be to conduct site visits 
				to Astoria, particularly on Steinway St, to see how reported data matches the lived experience on the ground.</p>

			<p>Stay tuned for those results!</p>
